User Generated Game Content Creation using Generative AI in Unity

This is my project submission for the AI for Media, Art, and Design (CS-E7770) course at Aalto University in 2024.

Project Idea

Create user-generated content (text elements, image elements, or both) for a game that has a collection of minigames based on user input.

Focus

Play-based Child Education through Visual, Auditory* & Reading based learnings.

Project Goals

1. Explore and learn different aspects of media design such as text, image, and audio
2. Use the learnings to create a fully functioning project.


Setting Up Your OpenAI Account

To use the OpenAI API, you need to have an OpenAI account. Follow these steps to create an account and generate an API key:

1. Go to https://openai.com/api and sign up for an account
2. Once you have created an account, go to https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
3. Create a new secret key and save it

Saving Your Credentials

To request the OpenAI API, use your API key and organization name (if applicable). To avoid exposing your API key in your Unity project, save it in your device's local storage.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder called .openai in your home directory (e.g. C:User\UserName\ for Windows or ~\ for Linux or Mac)
2. Create a file called auth.json in the .openai folder
3. Add an api_key field and an organization field (if applicable) to the auth.json file and save it
Here is an example of what your auth.json file should look like:
